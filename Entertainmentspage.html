        <h1>My favourite novels</h1>
        <p>Books are friends who never leave your side. I find this saying to be very true as books have always been there for me. I enjoy reading books. 
            They have the power to help us travel through worlds without moving from our places. In addition, books also enhance our imagination. Growing up, my parents and teachers always encouraged me to read. They taught me the importance of reading.
             Subsequently, I have read several books. </p>

        <h1>My favourite songs</h1>
        <p>Listening to music gives humans huge amount of benefits towards their personal life.
             A lot of students listen to music to, help reduce stress, boost up their mood and provides motivation in their daily life.
              Music is an art of sound in time that expresses ideas and affection in significant forms through the components of rhythm, melody, harmony, and colour. 
              Some students use music to overcome the emotional effects of stress or anxiety when engaged in their leisure time, such as studying for a test or quiz,
               completing homework or assignments that they were given by teachers or lecturers, or while reading and writing. </p>

                <h3>Lily</h3>
                <img src="lily.jpg" class="center">
                <p>I think it was about a girl who is powerless and depressed, yet young and beautiful full of dreams. The walls is her home where she finds stressful and hopeless. People who tries to warn her are her friends or family. She runs into the woods which means deep into the dangerous world full of unpredictable people/strangers. And there she met a stranger (maybe rich bad people) who wants deep relationship with her in exchange for wealth and love. Little did she know they are bad guys.
                     And then when she made a deal it was far more worse than her previous situation and she couldn't go back. Cause there's no turning back<br>
